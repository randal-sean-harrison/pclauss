                        <li>For Tuesday's class, print and read <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~pclauss/wr/handouts/onrhetoric.pdf">these excerpts from Aristotle's On Rhetoric</a>. Begin bringing this document to every class. Also, while reading,
                           consider:
                           Although On Rhetoric was written well over 2,000 years ago, where do you notice that Aristotle's points ring true even today? What stands out to you as noteworthy, interesting, challenging, or puzzling?</li>
                        <li>Also for Tuesday, examine <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~pclauss/wr/handouts/toulminschema.pdf">this document, showing the structure of a sample "micro-argument."</a> After either printing the document or copying the
                           structure in
                           your own notes, try to ascertain the purpose of each of the six phrases or clauses: What is the function of each category in the structure? What is each category's relationship to its counterparts? </li>
                        <li> If you have a laptop or tablet that's easy to carry, bring it to class on Thursday, August 30. You'll also need electronic access to Writing Exercises #1 and #2. (#2 has not yet been assigned.)</li>

                        <li>Also, personalize your <a href="https://eportfolio.nd.edu/" target="blank">ePortfolio</a> by adding a picture of yourself, changing the background, etc.
                        <li>Begin thinking of your own potential topics for your <a href="arguments.html#evaluation">Evaluation Argument</a>.

                        <li>Note: You do not yet need to print any of the above essays. However, when you read them, mentally "chunk" or "gloss" each one of them by noting the claims (both major and minor) and the evidence/data in each paragraph.
                           (What your high school teachers may have called a thesis statement, I call a major claim. What they may have called a topic sentence, I call a minor claim.)
                        <li>Also consider, when reading the above essays, how tight and/or focused they are. How would you rank the arguments, in order of quality? Why?

                           you'll hand in a paper copy in class (printed or handwritten). You'll also place a copy in your ePortfolio. (This can be an upload: a pdf,
