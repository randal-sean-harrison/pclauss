            <h4>Topics and Rhetorical Purposes</h4>

            <p>We are reading and discussing Dr. Martin Luther King's brilliant "Letter from a Birmingham Jail." King writes about issues he not only cares a great deal about but also has personal experiences with. In the spirit of or inspired by
               King's "Letter," what is a problem, an activity, an event, a program, an issue, an idea, that you have experience with, care about, and think your reader should care about, too? What is your experience with and subsequent stand on the
               issue? Further, how would you like to affect your reader's thinking and/or actions? (What is your Ultimate Goal, and how will you get your reader there?)</p>

            <h4>Troubles vs Issues</h4>

            <p>While considering potential topics, remember the distinction between what sociologist Peter Berger identifies as a "trouble" and an "issue":</p>

            <p>A trouble occurs within your own character and your immediate relations with others; an issue has to do with matters that, while they certainly may affect you
               personally, they also transcend your immediate environment and range of inner life. </p>

            <p>In other words, a trouble is a private matter, whereas an issue is a public matter. Furthermore, other people are affected by the issue, including not just you and/or your
               audience. For instance, if your parents won't let you go visit a friend in Colorado over fall break, that's a trouble. If your former high school principal recently enacted
               a school-wide policy you disagree with (e.g., banning t-shirts with the American flag on them), that's an issue.</p>

            <p>You're writing about an issue, not a trouble.</p>


            <h4>Four General Options:</h4>
            <p>
               While thinking of potential topics and audiences, you have four approaches available as options:
               <ol>
                  <li>You can write a Private Letter to a specific, real person. This would be an argument intended only for the recipient (e.g., "Dear Father Jenkins").</li>
                  <li>You can write an Open Letter to a specific, real person. This would be an argument intended not only for the recipient ("Dear Father Jenkins") but also for
                     anyone else who would happen to read the publication in which the open letter appears. (King's "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" is a type of open letter:
                     It is addressed to the seven clergymen, but King knew it would appear in other publications and be read by many other people.)</li>
                  <li>You can write an argument to a fictitious reader, an "Ideal Reader." For example, you might envision this as "My Ideal Reader is someone who is currently trying
                     to decide whether or not to . . . "</li>
                  <li>You can write an argument in reply to another, published argument, one that appeared in our campus newspaper, The Observer (in the "Viewpoint" section). If
                     you chose this option, remember that you're addressing your argument to the writer of the piece to which you're responding. Also, if you chose this option, you will
                     need to submit a copy of the original argument with your argument.</li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                  Be sure to specify, in the Situation Statement that will accompany your essay, which of the above choices you have selected.
                  If you're stumped for ideas, here are two options to consider.</p>

               <h4>Other Relevant Criteria</h4>

               <ul>
                  <li>Weight: 9
                  <li>Length: minimum of 4 (full) typed, double-spaced pages (See student samples for examples of the correct format.)</li>
                  <li>Highlighted Criteria: content (claims and evidence or data); organization; recognition of complexity of issue(s); and recognition of (and response to) reader's beliefs,
                     values, and needs</li>
                  <li>Situation: Your Qualifications, Intended Audience and Audience's Stance (or description of "Ideal Audience"), and Ultimate Goal(s) identified
                     at the start of the paper, single-spaced just above the title.</li>
                  <li>Sources: We're moving, now, from using artistic proofs only (in the Evaluation Argument) to using both artistic and inartistic proofs. So, you will need to use at
                     least two outside sources for this essay. Note, however, that this is not a "research paper": The two or more sources will supplement, not dominate, your argument.</li>
                  <li>Sources, again: Don't automatically think "an outside source" or "a source" means you must only use information from the Hesburgh Library, a website, or some other
                     similar sort of resource. Interviews with someone involved in or affected by the issue, for instance, can be a compelling source, as can other sites for information.</li>
                  <li>Can you use "I" in this argument? Absolutely. In fact, it's pretty much required. (I'll explain in class.)</li>
                  <li>A few words about audience: One thing that distinguishes this essay from the next essay you'll write (the "Global" Argument Essay), is the scope/range of the audience.
                     This essay's audience will be rather limited: just one person or only a few people you already know OR just one person or a few people whose stance toward the topic
                     is stable, accessible, and easily-defined. Your audience can be a real person, including someone you actually know. Your audience could also be a fiction, an "ideal reader."</li>
                  <li>A few more words about audience: You may see, in some sample student papers or topics, arguments where the intended audience is younger and/or less sophisticated or
                     educated than the writer. I will allow you to write to an audience slightly younger than you, but if you want to write to someone more than two years your junior, you must
                     clear it with me first.</li>
               </ul>
