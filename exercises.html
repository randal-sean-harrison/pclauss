                  This exercise can address any or all of the following questions--whatever helps you generate a number of
                  ideas or possibilities for your upcoming essay. (The more you write, the better.)
                  <p>
                  Also, keep in mind that--perhaps ironically--it's really best if you forget about the upcoming essay while
                  writing this exercise. Just let the ideas flow; don't "self-censor" at this point of the writing process.
                  (A common mistake at this point is to have a good idea, not realize it's a good idea, and not write it down. Trust in the Force.)
                  <p>
                  <ul>

                  <li>Some of you are only a few minutes or hours from home; others are much, much farther away from home. As you think about your friends, family, and
                  others you know outside of ND, who comes to mind as memorable or important? What's your best friend like? Who's someone you'd be happy never
                  to see again? Why? If you were to describe that person with just a few adjectives, what adjectives would you use? Why? Can you provide
                  some explanation?</li>
                  <li>If you currently play or have played an organized sport, what were your coaches like? Have you had any especially good or bad ones?</li>
                  <li>What about high school, junior high, or elementary school teachers? Any one stand out as different, quirky, weak, strong . . . ?</li>
                  <li>What kinds of jobs have you had? Was your last job a good place to work? a bad place? Why?</li>
                  <li>What about you? What are some of your best qualities? and/or What are some things about yourself you'd like to change?</li>
                  <li>Think and write for a few moments about your hometown and your favorite or least favorite places: If I were to visit
                  your hometown for a week or so, where would you suggest I go out to eat? What are some of your favorite restaurants?</li>
                  Least favorite? What about parks, places to hang out, etc? Good places? Bad places?</li>
                  <li>What about other topics I'm not thinking of here? Anything else you want to kick around as possibly worth writing about for your essay?</li>
                  </ul>

                  and <a href="handouts/toulmingretzky.pdf" target="blank">this example</a>, construct your own Toulmin micro-argument.</li>

                  <li>Remember, though, to have all <a href="handouts/toulminterms.pdf" target="blank">six parts</a> to your argument. And
                  lay out your argument to look the same as <a href="handouts/toulminlabels.pdf" target="blank">this one.</a></li>

<li>Or, related to the above question, if Father Jenkins invited you to his office for one hour, to talk about what is good and bad about Notre Dame, what would you discuss with him?</li>

                  <p>Before completing this exercise, which is worth two Writing Exercises (up to 10 pts), watch the Frontline segments available here: "A Class Divided."</p>

                  <p>Also read "Racial Bias, Even When We Have Good Intentions." </p>


                  <ul>
                    <li>Respond to any or all of the following questions about Jane Elliott's workshop and lessons:

<li>What do you think the experiment or process reveals about human nature in general? Is about much more than just eye color or skin color? </li>
  Does it uncover any deeper issues or truths about people-- issues or truths that cut across all sorts of boundaries (eye color, skin color, gender, etc)?</li>
<li>After watching the segments about the children, do you think you'd want your kids to experience this? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Anything else you'd like to comment on about the segments? For instance, what issues were discussed in class that you would like to explore more? </li>
  <li>What did we not discuss in class that is worth considering?</li>
</ul>
    <p>This is the same length as most other Writing Exercises, a minimum of 540-550 words, but it's worth two Writing Exercises since it requires watching all of "A Class Divided."</p>

                    First, write your intended situation statement at the top of the entry. Next, use the words in bold below as subheadings in your entry.
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Audience:</b> What do you know about your audience? What about the audience's values, interests, hobbies, fears, concerns,
                    goals, attitudes toward topic, etc.?
                    <p>
                    <li><b>Goal-Directed:</b> What do you hope to accomplish, both during your argument and as a result of your argument? Think in terms of frames of mind, not
                    just your ultimate goal. Also, remember the Candy Land analogy, "the stops along the way" to your Ultimate Goal.
                    <p>
                    <li><b>Supported: </b>What are your experiences with the topic/program/idea/etc? What reasons support your position? What are benefits to
                    your perspective, stance, etc?
                    <p>
                    <li><b>Multi-Sided:</b> What are drawbacks to your position? What are weaknesses or limits to your argument and/or strengths on the other side?
                    (For instance, why might the audience not want to accept your claim(s) or move toward your goals?
                    <p>
                    </li>

                  <li>At this point of the writing process, the more complete your draft
                  is--especially in relation to content and organization--the better.</li>
                  <li>The points for this exercise are based on quantity, not quality: Do you have a minimum of 4 full pages,
                  double-spaced with 1" margins?</li>
                  <li>Remember, because we'll be using this exercise/draft in writing groups in class, you cannot get an extension
                  for this assignment. Bring to class what you have done.</li>
                  <li>Double-sided printing, to save paper, is fine.</li>
                  <li>Also, remember that the Local Argument Essay requires at least two outside sources. However, it's fine if you don't yet use any sources in your draft.
                  <li>Here's the <a href="handouts/essayformat.doc" target="blank">essay
                    format template</a>. With your draft and final copy, remember to include your situation statement, single-spaced right below your title.</li>
